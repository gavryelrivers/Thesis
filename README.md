# Thesis
Hi all! Welcome to my thesis depository on Github, just one thing, I forgot to tell u at the beginning, I still don't have any master thesis topic (shame on me, I know). Anyway, it is still too early to know on which topic I will do it (or at least that's what I keep telling to myself). I might have a cool topic at the end, probably on those werewolf copepods that rise in full moon nights, because who wanna do a thesis on reef sharks or marine mammals??, they are soooooo boring and predictable.
